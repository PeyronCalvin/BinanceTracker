# BINANCE TRACKER



## Purpose of this project

This project is **still under work** and is done in order to enhance my fluency on C# and .Net using Blazor framework. Moreover, as a binance account owner, I find it cool to have my own app to track my portfolio or even make new transactions from it !

## How to use it ?

Steps :

* Create a new Folder called **Keys** inside of BinanceApp folder
* Follow Binance API documentation to generate your RSA keys and create your API on the Binance app
* Inside of the newly created Keys folder, add your keys inside of files called **privateKey.pem** and **publicKey.pem**
* Run it and test it !
